A simple Real Estate Website created by using HTML, CSS, 
JavaScript, Next.js and RapidAPI to fetch the data.

The Features of the website are:
- Advanced Property Filtering.
- Displaying property details with an image carousel.

In the making of this project I emulated practices such as:
- Folder and File Structure.
- React Hooks.
- Static generation.
- Server Side Rendering.

The website is hosted on vercel and can be accessed through the link: https://cmka-realestate-is7l5fuh9-makafuia.vercel.app/
